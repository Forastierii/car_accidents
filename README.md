# car_accidents
This project based on a real issue I have. I have always heard about traffic in Santa Catarina before moving down here, so I wanted to explore reasons behind crashes, identify possible accident patterns and even propose solutions to the Federal Highway Police (Polícia Rodoviária Federal).

For this project, we will be using:
- Real data from the Federal Highway Police (source below, as a CSV)
- Machine learning modelling (PCA and Clustering)
  - Types of accidents that render similar outcomes of fatalities / injuries
  - Regions where accidents are clustered by type and conditions
  - Seasonality during weekdays and outlier detection
  - Preditive model for holiday police force planning
- Data engineering tools (Travis CI and Codecov for continuous integration).
