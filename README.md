# car_accidents
This proejct based on a real issue I have. I have always heard about traffic in Santa Catarina before moving down here, so I wanted to explore reasons behind crashes, identify possible accident patterns and even propose solutions to the Federal Highway Police (Polícia Rodoviária Federal).

For this project, we will be using real data from the Federal Highway Police (source below, as a CSV), machine learning techniques (PCA and Clustering) and data engineering techniques (Travis CI and Codecov for continuous integration).
